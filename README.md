## Project Description
The purpose of this paper is to determine if the number of tourist destinations affects the number of Wisatawan Nusantara (Wisnus) trips in Indonesia and to determine the prediction model using the panel data regression method. Wisatawan Nusantara (Wisnus) are Indonesian residents who travel within Indonesia's territory, for a period of less than 6 months, and not for a working purpose (earning wages/salaries). The dataset used in this project is the data on the number of Wisatawan Nusantara (Wisnus) trips in each province in Indonesia in between 2018 and 2019 as well as the data on the number of various types of tourist destinations in 2018 and 2019 in all the provinces in Indonesia to conclude that there are several factors which affects the number of Wisatawan Nusantara (Wisnus) trips in Indonesia.

## Methods
